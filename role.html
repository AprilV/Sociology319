                <p>This website and accompanying documentation (553+ lines of process notes) constitute active 
                contribution to knowledge accessibility—transforming tacit experiential knowledge into transmissible 
                frameworks.</p>

                <h4>Documentation Rationale:</h4>
                <ul style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li>General population observes AI collaboration outcomes without visibility into process mechanics</li>

                    patterns) visible and analyzable</li>
                    <li>Public GitHub repository enables free access to process documentation without institutional barriers</li>

                    <strong>Theoretical contribution:</strong> Comprehensive documentation transforms individual case study 
                    into educational resource. Other learners can identify patterns, adapt successful strategies, and 
                    develop competencies based on documented trajectory rather than trial-and-error experimentation.

                    requirements</li>
                    <li>When peers inquire about accelerated project completion, emphasis on process over outcomes demonstrates 
                    methodology</li>
                    <li>Documentation of failures and debugging alongside successes presents realistic rather than idealized
