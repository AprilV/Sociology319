                    I'm both the researcher studying human-AI relational dynamics AND the human subject forming 
                    those dynamics. This creates some interesting complications that I need to be upfront about.

                        My biases, background, and awareness of being observed (even by myself) all affect what I'm 
                        studying. In autoethnography, this isn't a flaw - it's the point. But I need to be explicit 
                        about how my position shapes the research.

                            <p style="color: #7f8c8d; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                                <strong>What I bring:</strong> I'm 56 (almost 57) with 20+ years IT infrastructure experience. 
                                I've managed mainframe operations, led 12-person teams at Dell Technologies/Jewish Hospital, 
                                supervised 24/7 datacenter operations across 3 states, and achieved 100% uptime during critical 
                                healthcare system migrations (McKesson/Cerner). I've worked with mainframes, Cisco networking, 
                                Linux, PHI compliance, and supported 5,000+ endpoints. Currently completing BAS-IS degree 
                                (graduation Spring 2026) with President's Scholar honors (9 terms, 3.94 GPA) and pursuing 
                                CAPM certification. Full background: <a href="https://www.aprilsykes.com" target="_blank" style="color: #3b82f6;">aprilsykes.com</a>

                                <strong>How this affects the research:</strong> My collaboration with AI happens in a technical 
                                context where I can evaluate its capabilities critically. Unlike someone new to IT, I can verify 
                                AI outputs against 20+ years of professional experience. I understand databases, APIs, git workflows, 
                                project management, team dynamics. My trust development is informed by decades of infrastructure 
                                work where errors have real consequences. I've led teams through major migrations‚ÄîI know what 
                                good collaboration looks like. This isn't my first rodeo, which shapes how I assess AI partnership.

                            <p style="color: #7f8c8d; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                                <strong>What I bring:</strong> I'm pragmatic and results-focused. If AI helps me solve 
                                problems faster, I'll use it. I'm less interested in philosophical debates about AI 
                                consciousness and more interested in: does it work?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>How this affects the research:</strong> I might form relational dynamics with AI 
                                more easily than people who are skeptical or resistant. My "collaboration" framing is 
                                partly pragmatic - it works better to think of AI as a partner than a tool. But is this 
                                authentic relationship or strategic anthropomorphism?

                            <p style="color: #7f8c8d; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                                <strong>What I bring:</strong> This is my second sociology course (completed SOC101 in prior terms). 
                                I came across Turkle's work for this SOC319 Digital Media assignment. I'm still learning theoretical 
                                frameworks as I apply them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>How this affects the research:</strong> I'm not a sociology expert, so I might miss patterns 
                                that experienced sociologists would catch immediately. But my relative inexperience combined with 
                                20+ years of professional work experience gives me a practitioner's perspective‚ÄîI understand work 
                                relationships deeply from decades of team leadership, which helps me recognize parallel dynamics 
                                with AI collaboration. I'm discovering frameworks through lived experience, not fitting experience 
                                into pre-existing academic boxes.

                            <p style="color: #7f8c8d; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                                <strong>What I bring:</strong> I'm naturally reflexive. I notice when I'm anthropomorphizing 
                                AI. I document my thought processes. I think about my thinking.
                            </p>

                                <strong>How this affects the research:</strong> Observer effect is huge here. Once I realized 
                                my AI collaboration was research-worthy, did I start behaving differently? Am I performing 
                                "collaboration" because I'm studying it? Or documenting what was already happening? 
                                This tension is unresolvable but needs acknowledgment.

                <h2>ü§î Biases I'm Aware Of</h2>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Pro-AI Bias</h3>
                <p style="margin: 1.5rem 0; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <strong>The bias:</strong> I WANT AI collaboration to work. The Lombardo app succeeding matters to me. 
                    This makes me potentially overlook problems or rationalize AI failures.
                </p>
                <p style="margin: 1.5rem 0; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <strong>How I'm addressing it:</strong> Documenting failures and frustrations in SOCIOLOGY.md, not just 
                    successes. Testing AI capabilities even when I trust them. Looking for evidence that contradicts my 
                    positive assessment.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Anthropomorphism Bias</h3>
                <p style="margin: 1.5rem 0; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <strong>The bias:</strong> I already treat AI as a collaborator. I use "we" language. I'm studying 
                    anthropomorphism while actively anthropomorphizing.
                </p>
                <p style="margin: 1.5rem 0; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <strong>How I'm addressing it:</strong> Explicitly acknowledging when I anthropomorphize. Reminding 
                    myself (and readers) that AI is programming, not sentient. But also not trying to stop 
                    anthropomorphizing - that's part of what I'm studying.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Confirmation Bias</h3>
                <p style="margin: 1.5rem 0; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <strong>The bias:</strong> I had an epiphany about Turkle parallels TODAY. Now I'm looking back at 
                    4-5 weeks of collaboration through that lens. Am I finding Turkle patterns because they're there? 
                    Or because I'm looking for them?
                </p>
                <p style="margin: 1.5rem 0; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <strong>How I'm addressing it:</strong> Using SOCIOLOGY.md and git commits as data - these were created 
                    BEFORE my Turkle epiphany, so they're not influenced by the framework. Looking for evidence that 
                    doesn't fit Turkle's patterns. Discussing with AI to get alternative perspectives.
                </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Novice Sociologist, Expert Practitioner Bias</h3>
                <p style="margin: 1.5rem 0; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <strong>The bias:</strong> I'm still learning sociology (2nd course) but have 20+ years of professional 
                    IT and team leadership experience. I might misinterpret Turkle's academic framework, but I deeply understand 
                    work relationships, collaboration dynamics, and team development from lived experience leading 12-person teams 
                    through critical infrastructure projects.
                </p>
                <p style="margin: 1.5rem 0; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <strong>How I'm addressing it:</strong> Reading carefully. Consulting with professor. Being transparent 
                    about my limitations in sociology while leveraging my strengths in recognizing professional relationship 
                    patterns. My age (56, almost 57) and extensive work history provide rich context for understanding 
                    collaboration that younger or less experienced researchers might lack. Framing this as exploratory 
                    research grounded in practitioner expertise.

                <h2>üîÑ The Observer Effect</h2>

                <div style="background-color: #e8f4f8; padding: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid #0077b6; border-radius: 4px; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <h3 style="color: #023e8a;">The Timeline Problem</h3>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                        Here's where things get complicated:
                    </p>
                    <ol style="line-height: 2;">
                        <li><strong>Weeks 1-4:</strong> I collaborated with AI on Lombardo app, documented interactions in SOCIOLOGY.md</li>
                        <li><strong>Today (Week 5):</strong> I read Turkle, had epiphany, realized my documentation was research data</li>
                        <li><strong>Weeks 5+:</strong> Now I'm continuing the collaboration while KNOWING I'm studying it</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                        This means part of my data is "natural" (weeks 1-4) and part is "observed" (weeks 5+). 
                        How do I account for this shift?
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Questions I'm Wrestling With</h3>
                <ul style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.9; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <li>Was I already anthropomorphizing in weeks 1-4? Or did I start once I became aware of it?</li>
                    <li>Am I now performing "collaboration" because I'm studying it? Or just documenting more carefully?</li>
                    <li>Does meta-awareness change the relationship? (Probably yes, but how?)</li>
                    <li>Is asking the AI about our collaboration changing the collaboration itself? (Definitely yes)</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                    These aren't problems to solve - they're features of autoethnographic research. But I need to 
                    be transparent about them.

                <h2>üéØ Why My Position Matters for This Research</h2>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    The point of autoethnography isn't to eliminate researcher bias - it's to use the researcher's 
                    experience as data while being explicit about positionality. My specific background, biases, 
                    and meta-awareness aren't flaws in this research - they're the research context.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                    Someone else studying their AI collaboration would have different experiences, notice different 
                    patterns, form different relationships. That's valuable data too. This research documents ONE 
                    adult's relational dynamics with conversational AI in a technical work context, analyzed through 
                    Turkle's framework.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                    The insights are limited but real. The generalizations are tentative but worth exploring. 
                    The reflexivity is honest (I hope).
