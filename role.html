                <p class="intro-text">
                    My professor wants us to reflect on our individual role in addressing digital media inequality. 
                    So basically: what am I actually <em>doing</em> about this problem I've identified?
                </p>

                    <strong>Note to self:</strong> I think my position is kind of interesting because I'm both part of 
                    the problem (I have advantages other students don't) AND trying to help? Like, I'm the person who 
                    "gets it" but that means I can maybe explain it to people who don't.

                <p><em>Basically I've become the unofficial "AI explainer" for people around me</em></p>

                <h4>Who I Talk To:</h4>
                <ul style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li><strong>Classmates</strong> who see my productivity and wonder how</li>

                        <p>I explain it's pattern matching, not consciousness. Like autocorrect but way more 
                        sophisticated. This usually calms the Terminator fears.</p>

                        <p>Emphasis on collaboration—AI helps you think through problems, doesn't replace you. 
                        You still make all the decisions.</p>

                        <p>I don't tell people they're wrong for being worried. I validate their concerns and 
                        then give them information that makes it less scary.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="overview-card">
                        <h3>"You can learn this"</h3>
                        <p>People think effective AI use is some technical superpower. I explain it's just 
                        practice—anyone can learn to work with AI well.</p>

                    read millions of books and can help you think through problems, but can't make decisions for you 
                    or act independently. It's a sophisticated pattern matcher, not a conscious being."</em>

            <div class="section-content">
                <h2>Thing 2: I Document Everything</h2>
                
                <p>This website and my sociology markdown file (553+ lines!) ARE part of my role—making my experience 
                visible so other people can learn from it.</p>

                <h4>Why Documentation Matters:</h4>
                <ul style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li>Most people don't see HOW effective AI collaboration works—they just see the result</li>
                    <li>I'm making the invisible process visible (how trust develops, how communication patterns work)</li>
                    <li>Everything's on GitHub, publicly accessible (free knowledge sharing)</li>
                    <li>Written in normal language, not academic jargon—anyone can understand it</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="margin-top: 2rem; padding: 1rem; background-color: #e8f4f8; border-left: 4px solid #0066cc; border-radius: 4px;">
                    <strong>My thinking:</strong> If I can document my collaboration well enough, other people can 
                    see what worked for me and adapt it to their situations. It's like... educational resource 
                    creation, I guess?
                </p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <h2>Thing 3: I'm a Living Example (Apparently)</h2>
                
                <p>My professor pointed out that other students struggle with AI while I don't. So just... existing 
                as someone who collaborates well with AI helps, I guess? It shows it's possible.</p>

                <h4>Why This Might Matter:</h4>
                <ul style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li>Seeing someone successfully work with AI makes it less scary for others</li>
                    <li>Counters the "AI will take over" narrative with "look, here's a normal person working with it fine"</li>
                    <li>When classmates ask how I finished my app, I explain the PROCESS not just the outcome</li>
                    <li>I share both successes AND failures (times AI messed up, times I had to debug) so it seems realistic</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="margin-top: 2rem; padding: 1rem; background-color: #fff3cd; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107; border-radius: 4px;">
                    <strong>Honest moment:</strong> I'm not totally sure if "being an example" counts as actively doing 
                    something? It feels kind of passive. But my professor suggested it matters for reducing fear, so I'm 
                    including it. Need to think more about whether this is sufficient.

                <p>Part of how I help people is being honest about this weird feeling. Like, I KNOW you're a program, 
                but working with you feels different than using other software. Admitting that confusion helps because:</p>

                <p>Okay so my professor wants us to be realistic about individual action. Here's what I CAN'T do:</p>

                        <h3>Scale Problem</h3>
                        <p>I can educate maybe dozens or hundreds of people. But millions struggle with this. Individual 
                        efforts can't fix structural inequalities alone.</p>

                        <p>People who read my stuff or ask me questions are ALREADY somewhat interested in AI. I'm 
                        probably not reaching the most resistant or most disadvantaged people.</p>

                <p>Moving forward (assuming my professor approves this project):</p>

                <ul style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.9; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <li><strong>Continue documenting</strong> my AI collaboration experiences so others can learn from them</li>
                    <li><strong>Look for opportunities to teach</strong> AI collaboration skills formally (workshops? tutorials? 
                    not sure yet)</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay critical</strong> about AI systems that reproduce inequality (use my technical + 
                    sociology knowledge to call out problems)</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep researching</strong> this topic beyond this class project</li>
                </ul>

                    <strong>Professor Note:</strong> Is this enough for the "individual role" requirement? I'm trying 
                    to balance being honest about limitations while showing I'm actually doing things. Let me know if 
                    I need to expand on any of this.

                <h2>The Bigger Idea</h2>
                
                <p>I think the main point is: <strong>people who benefit from technological advantages have a 
                responsibility to share knowledge and advocate for equity.</strong></p>

                <p>I got lucky with early AI adoption—combination of technical background, supportive environment, 
                and personal curiosity. That advantage comes with an obligation to help others access the same 
                benefits.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 2rem; font-style: italic; color: #555;">
                    So this whole sociology project IS my individual action. I'm studying my experience, documenting 
                    patterns, and making it publicly accessible. One person at a time, one conversation at a time, 
                    one documentation project at a time.
