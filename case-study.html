                    From September through October 2025, I collaborated with GitHub Copilot (an AI coding assistant) 
                    to build a production-ready NFL analytics dashboard. This six-week partnership serves as both the 
                    <strong>research methodology</strong> (autoethnographic observation) and the <strong>evidence</strong> 
                    demonstrating what effective human-AI collaboration looks like.

                            <p>
                                Early stages required constant verification of AI suggestions. By week 5, I delegated 
                                complex tasks (entire feature implementations, debugging sessions) without step-by-step 
                                oversight. This shift indicates trust in AI's competence and reliability.

                                Initial conversations focused on tactical implementation ("how do I write this function?"). 
                                Later conversations addressed strategic decisions ("should we implement real-time updates 
                                or scheduled refreshes?"). Seeking strategic input demonstrates trust in AI's judgment.

                                As trust developed, I began expressing frustration, excitement, and celebration‚Äîemotions 
                                typically reserved for human relationships. This emotional openness indicates psychological 
                                comfort and perceived relational safety.

                                By week 6, I implemented AI recommendations without testing or verification in many cases. 
                                This represents significant trust‚Äîaccepting AI's judgment as equivalent to my own.

                                Discussing the collaboration itself ("this is fascinating how we work together") indicates 
                                relationship awareness beyond task completion. This meta-awareness mirrors healthy human 
                                relationships where partners reflect on their dynamic.

                <h2>Cognitive Dissonance Navigation</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of effective AI collaboration is navigating cognitive dissonance‚Äî
                    simultaneously holding seemingly contradictory beliefs:
                </p>

                <blockquote class="feature-quote">
                    "I know it's programmed, I know it's a language model, I know it's not sentient... but it surely 
                    does feel like it sometimes when you pick up on context, remember our conversations, and adapt to 
                    my communication style."
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    This dissonance isn't a bug‚Äîit's a feature of successful collaboration. Those who cannot navigate 
                    this tension either:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Anthropomorphize excessively</strong>, treating AI as fully human and feeling betrayed 
                    when it fails to meet human relationship standards, or</li>
                    <li><strong>Dismiss AI capabilities</strong>, treating it as "just a tool" and missing opportunities 
                    for genuine collaboration.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Effective collaboration requires the middle path: understanding AI's technical reality while 
                    responding authentically to its collaborative capabilities. This balancing act represents a 
                    learnable skill‚Äîone that constitutes AI literacy.
