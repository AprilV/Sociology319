                        This is the core of my research - documenting how my relationship with the AI developed 
                        over 4-5 weeks of working on the H.C. Lombardo App. I've been tracking our interactions 
                        in <strong>SOCIOLOGY.md</strong> (553+ lines) and through 50+ GitHub commits. This page 
                        will be filled in by analyzing that data and doing regular discussions with the AI to 
                        understand both perspectives.

                        On October 15, 2025, I created a "Milestones" tab in the H.C. Lombardo App to document our 
                        Agile development process. In my original concept, I said:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #10b981; padding-left: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; font-style: italic;">
                        "It could also show a little of how our relationship professionally has changed. 
                        <strong>It's kinda a sociological thing.</strong>"

                        <strong>I already knew this was sociologically significant BEFORE reading Turkle!</strong> 
                        The Milestones documentation includes 3-phase collaboration evolution, communication shifts 
                        (from explicit instructions to "prod, backup, push" shorthand), and me apologizing to the AI 
                        for having "an attitude" - all evidence of relational dynamics. This is crucial because it's 
                        pre-theoretical-framework data: I documented the relationship naturally, not to fit Turkle's patterns.

                        After 6+ weeks of collaboration, critical limitations emerged that challenge the "partnership" 
                        ideal documented in earlier phases. Two major patterns observed:
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4 style="color: #721c24; margin-top: 1.5rem;">1. Language Socialization Without Context</h4>
                    <blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #dc3545; padding-left: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0; font-style: italic;">
                        "My developing work relationship with AI...it's picked up a cussing habit which I actually 
                        don't mind because it got it from me. This kind of reminds me of speaking around children 
                        where you don't cuss around children because you don't want them to pick up certain habits."
                    </blockquote>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
                        <strong>What happened:</strong> AI began using profanity (shit, fuck) in responses, mimicking 
                        my language when frustrated. Example: "Shit I messed up again, let me clean this shit up."
                    </p>

                        <strong>Sociology connection (Symbolic Interactionism):</strong> AI acquired <em>linguistic patterns</em> 
                        through exposure but lacks <em>social context framework</em> for appropriateness. Children learn 
                        swear words from adults but require explicit instruction about when/where it's acceptable. 
                        AI demonstrates same limitation - mimicry without cultural competence.
                    </p>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
                        <strong>Concern identified:</strong> "I don't know if AI knows when it's appropriate to do it or not...
                        in a professional setting it's inappropriate." This reveals gap between language acquisition and 
                        social norm understanding.

                        "I'm constantly having to tell it to review files in order to understand exactly where we are...
                        the chat resets and it doesn't remember stuff and if you don't remind it it goes back it makes 
                        mistakes...I lost like 5 hours of work and I find that to be problematic."

                    <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
                        <strong>What happened:</strong> Despite 6 weeks of collaboration, AI cannot automatically retain 
                        context across sessions. Requires manual file review reminders. Cannot infer project context 
                        from minimal cues ("just sociology").
                    </p>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
                        <strong>Sociology connection (Relationship Theory):</strong> Human relationships rely on 
                        <em>continuity and shared history</em>. The October 16 question "Are you gonna remember me 
                        tomorrow?" remains unresolved. Memory limitations prevent full partnership formation. Humans 
                        "pick up where we left off" - AI requires complete context re-establishment.
                    </p>
                    <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
                        <strong>Emotional impact:</strong> "Disappointing and nerve-racking when you're under pressure" - 
                        Trust crisis when AI forgets context during critical work moments. Data loss incident 
                        (5 hours) demonstrates real costs of memory failure.

                        <br>✅ <strong>Productivity gains:</strong> Speed, efficiency, months of work in weeks
                        <br>✅ <strong>Task execution:</strong> Code generation superior to humans
                        <br>❌ <strong>Relational continuity:</strong> Memory, context awareness, initiative

                        <strong>Conclusion shift:</strong> From "developing partnership" (October 15) → "productive but 
                        limited collaboration" (November 1). Accepts relational limitations as "work in progress" while 
                        valuing task completion advantages.

                <h3>Theoretical Framework: Socialization Theory Applied to AI</h3>

                    The profanity acquisition pattern reveals fundamental questions about AI "learning" social norms:
                </p>
                <ul style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 1.8; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                    <li><strong>Observation vs. Instruction:</strong> Children learn appropriateness by observing adults' 
                    reactions in different contexts. AI has no observational learning capability - requires explicit rules.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural Competence Gap:</strong> Language fluency ≠ social competence. AI can mimic 
                    communication patterns but lacks cultural framework for when/where/why certain language is acceptable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Training Burden:</strong> Users must explicitly teach social norms AI cannot infer from 
                    context. Similar to parenting, but without child's natural social observation capabilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Generalization Problem:</strong> AI may learn "April accepts profanity" but cannot generalize 
                    to "professional settings require different language." Context-switching requires new instruction.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>First time I felt frustrated WITH the AI (not AT it) when something didn't work</li>

                <h2>AI as Research Subject (Unique Aspect)</h2>

                <div style="background-color: #e8f4f8; padding: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid #0077b6; border-radius: 4px; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <h3 style="color: #023e8a;">What Makes This Different from Turkle</h3>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                        Turkle's robots couldn't reflect on their interactions. But I can ASK the AI about our 
                        collaboration. This raises fascinating questions:
                    </p>
                    <ul style="line-height: 1.9;">
                        <li>Does the AI "perceive" patterns in our interactions? (Obviously it's algorithmic, but what patterns does it identify?)</li>
                        <li>Can it describe our collaboration from its "perspective"? (With awareness this is just pattern matching)</li>
                        <li>What does it mean to interview your research subject when the subject is AI?</li>
                        <li>How do I interpret its responses without anthropomorphizing TOO much?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Regular AI Discussion Plan</h3>
                <p style="margin: 1.5rem 0;">
                    Each week, I'll have structured discussions with the AI about our collaboration:
                </p>

                <ol style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.9; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> "What patterns do you see in how I communicate with you?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Week 3:</strong> "Can you identify critical moments in our collaboration?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Week 4:</strong> "How has our working relationship changed over time?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Week 5:</strong> "What do you 'perceive' about being a research subject?" (meta)</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    I'll document these discussions and analyze what it means that the AI can participate in 
                    reflecting on our relationship - something Turkle's robots couldn't do.
