                    serves as the observational site for examining collaborative dynamics with GitHub Copilot.

                    and the experiential differences between AI-assisted and traditional software development.

                <p>
                    Trust formation in human relationships develops through repeated positive interactions and demonstrated 
                    reliability. Observed AI collaboration patterns followed analogous developmental trajectories:

                                Initial interactions required comprehensive verification of all generated code. By Week 5, 
                                delegation of complex multi-step tasks (complete feature implementations, autonomous debugging 
                                sessions) occurred without real-time monitoring. This behavioral shift represents measurable 
                                increase in trust regarding AI competence and output reliability.

                                Early conversations centered on tactical implementation questions ("syntax for database query").

                                As collaboration progressed, communication included expression of frustration during obstacles,

                                By Week 6, direct implementation of AI recommendations without intermediate testing or

                <p>
                    Technical awareness of AI's non-sentient nature coexists with subjective experience of understanding 
                    and responsiveness. This creates ongoing cognitive dissonance requiring conscious management of 
                    contradictory mental models.

                <p>
                    <strong>Research significance:</strong> This conceptual tension may constitute a fundamental barrier 
                    to effective AI collaboration. Users must simultaneously maintain two incompatible frameworks:

                    <li><strong>Experiential phenomenology:</strong> Subjective perception of comprehension and contextual responsiveness</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Failure to navigate this dissonance produces two maladaptive patterns:

                    <li><strong>Reductive instrumentalism:</strong> Dismissing AI as "just a tool," preventing recognition
