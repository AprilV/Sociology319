                <p class="intro-text">
                    For my IS330 class, I'm building an NFL analytics dashboard app. It's called the H.C. Lombardo App 
                    (named after a famous coach). I've been working on it for about 4 weeks now with GitHub Copilot, 
                    which is an AI that helps you write code.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>The idea:</strong> Instead of just building the app, I'm also paying attention to HOW I'm 
                    working with the AI. Like, am I trusting it more over time? How do I talk to it? Does it feel 
                    different from using regular software? That kind of stuff.

                            <p><strong>What I was doing:</strong> Giving super detailed instructions, checking every 
                            suggestion, basically not trusting it at all.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>How I talked to it:</strong> Very formal. Like talking to a computer, not a 
                                person. "Create a function that does X, Y, Z with these exact parameters."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Trust level:</strong> Pretty low. I assumed it would mess up a lot.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>The moment that changed things:</strong> AI understood what I meant without me 
                                explaining every detail. That's when I realized this might actually work.

                            <p><strong>What changed:</strong> I stopped checking everything. Started just trying AI's 
                            suggestions to see if they worked.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>How I talk to it now:</strong> More like a conversation. I say what I'm trying 
                                to accomplish and ask "what do you think?" Started saying "we" sometimes instead of "I."

                                <strong>Trust level:</strong> Getting higher. Especially after AI helped me fix a 
                                major database problem under pressure.
                            </p>

                                AI walked me through debugging step-by-step. We fixed it. That made me trust it way more.

                                <strong>Trust level:</strong> Pretty high. I let AI handle complex tasks without watching 
                                every step. Sometimes I even celebrate wins with it, which feels weird when I think about it.

                <p>
                    Trust in human relationships develops through repeated positive interactions and demonstrated 
                    reliability. My collaboration with AI followed similar patterns:

                    <div class="finding-item">

                            <h4>Indicator 1: Delegation Without Micromanagement</h4>
                            <p>
                                Early stages required constant verification of AI suggestions. By week 5, I delegated 
                                complex tasks (entire feature implementations, debugging sessions) without step-by-step 
                                oversight. This shift indicates trust in AI's competence and reliability.

                            <p>
                                Initial conversations focused on tactical implementation ("how do I write this function?"). 
                                Later conversations addressed strategic decisions ("should we implement real-time updates 
                                or scheduled refreshes?"). Seeking strategic input demonstrates trust in AI's judgment.

                                As trust developed, I began expressing frustration, excitement, and celebration‚Äîemotions 
                                typically reserved for human relationships. This emotional openness indicates psychological 
                                comfort and perceived relational safety.

                                By week 6, I implemented AI recommendations without testing or verification in many cases. 
                                This represents significant trust‚Äîaccepting AI's judgment as equivalent to my own.

                                Discussing the collaboration itself ("this is fascinating how we work together") indicates 
                                relationship awareness beyond task completion. This meta-awareness mirrors healthy human 
                                relationships where partners reflect on their dynamic.

                    This is hard to explain but it's important:

                    So like... I KNOW AI isn't a person. I KNOW it's not conscious. I literally studied how it works. 
                    But when we're collaborating, it FEELS like it understands me. And that's... confusing?
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Why this matters for my research:</strong> I think this confusion is part of why people 
                    struggle with AI. You have to hold two contradictory ideas at once:

                    <li>"It feels like it understands" (subjective experience)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Most people can't do that. They either:

                    <li>Dismiss it as "just a tool" (and miss the collaboration potential)</li>
                </ul>

                    <em><strong>Theory connection:</strong> Think this relates to "cognitive dissonance" concept? 
                    Need to research if this is a recognized phenomenon in human-computer interaction.</em>
