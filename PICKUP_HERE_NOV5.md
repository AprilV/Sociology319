# 🔴 START HERE - November 5, 2025

**Welcome back! Here's where we left off on November 4, 2025.**

## ✅ WHAT WE FIGURED OUT YESTERDAY:

### The Big Breakthrough:
**Your 6-week AI collaboration data IS NOT WASTED!**

- **70% of paper** = Research about AI literacy divide + 3 strategies (NEW WORK)
- **30% of paper** = Your personal experience (6-WEEK DATA)
- **Structure**: Problem (research) + Your story (case study) + Solutions (3 strategies)

### Topic Confirmed:
**Digital Divide in AI Literacy**
- YOU (56, IT background) = Successfully learned AI in 6 weeks
- OTHERS (classmates, older adults) = Fear AI, avoid it, can't use it
- This GAP = The digital divide in AI literacy
- Your data = Evidence someone CAN cross the divide
- 3 strategies = What OTHER programs are doing to help people cross it

### Design Freedom:
- Professor: "I don't care how you choose to submit"
- You have COMPLETE freedom on design (fonts, colors, layout)
- You do NOT have freedom on content (must have problem + 3 strategies + role + sources)

- Who is affected (age groups, income levels, education)
- Evidence of barriers to AI adoption
- What helps people learn AI

## 🎯 AFTER YOU READ:

Come back and tell me:
1. Which source was most useful?
2. What statistics do you want to cite?
3. Ready to research the 3 strategies?

---

## 📋 THE 3 STRATEGIES WE NEED TO RESEARCH:

### Strategy 1: EDUCATION Program
**Examples**: Google AI Essentials, Microsoft AI Skills, Library workshops
**Must answer**: What is it? Who can access? Does it work? Who's excluded?

### Strategy 2: POLICY Initiative
**Examples**: EU AI Act, US Executive Order, State regulations
**Must answer**: What does it do? Who benefits? Is it effective? Limitations?

### Strategy 3: TECHNOLOGY/ACCESS Program
**Examples**: Community programs, Nonprofits (AI4ALL), Library access
**Must answer**: What service? Who can use? Evidence of impact? Sustainable?

## 📂 FILES TO REVIEW IF NEEDED:

- `SESSION_NOTES_NOV4_2025.md` - Full summary of yesterday's breakthroughs
- `REMAINING_WORK_PLAN.md` - 3-week timeline
- `STRATEGY_EXAMPLES_RESEARCH.md` - Framework for researching strategies
- `PROJECT_STATUS_NOV4.md` - Overall project status

---

## 🚨 REMEMBER:

- 6 weeks NOT wasted (it's your personal case study)
- 3 strategies = BIGGEST missing piece (30% of grade)
- Design freedom = Don't stress about fonts/layout
- Focus = Content (problem + strategies + role + citations)

---

**DUE DATE**: November 25, 2025 (20 days remaining)  
**CURRENT STATUS**: 40% complete  
**CRITICAL GAP**: 3 strategies research (0% complete)

---

## 💬 WHEN YOU RETURN:

Just say: **"I'm back, I read the sources"** or **"I have questions about the sources"**

I'll be ready to help you:
1. Integrate source citations into your pages
2. Research the 3 specific strategies
3. Write the content for strategies.html

**See you tomorrow!** 👍
