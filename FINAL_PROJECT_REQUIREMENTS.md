## PROFESSOR'S KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER

### From Final Project Instructions:
1. **"I don't care how you choose to submit"** - Website is perfect ✅
2. **"Reliable evidence from sociological standpoint"** - Use theoretical perspectives ✅
3. **"Try not to look for three similar examples"** - Seek VARIATION in strategies ⚠️
4. **"How do you see your role"** - Already documented as educator/bridge-builder ✅
5. **"You have to make a pretty dang good case for 'I don't have a role'"** - N/A, you have clear role ✅

### From Unit III Lecture:
1. **"This class is not opinion, but theoretical perspectives and research"** - Use peer-reviewed sources ✅
2. **"Pay attention to stats on larger trends or citations"** - Not just anecdotal evidence ✅
3. **"Think about how you confront these topics in the field"** - Educator role addresses this ✅

---

## ALIGNMENT WITH OBJECTIVES ✅

### Unit III Objective 1: "Analyze ways digital technology impacts social change and inequality"
✅ AI literacy as NEW digital divide beyond internet access
✅ Workforce inequality (those who collaborate vs. those who fear)
✅ Educational inequality (students comfortable vs. avoiding)

### Unit III Objective 2: "Evaluate and devise strategies to eliminate unequal access"
⚠️ Three strategies identified but need evaluation
✅ Individual role clearly defined (educator/bridge-builder)

## NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTION

**This week (Nov 3-9):**
1. Start with Ellis et al. (2011) - it's FREE and legitimizes your methodology
2. Read Waytz et al. (2014) - shortest source, explains trust development
3. Begin researching specific examples for 3 strategies

**You're 85% done. Just need to finish strategies evaluation and add citations!**
