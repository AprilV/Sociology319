                    "Wait. This is literally what we're studying in sociology right now. 
                    Sherry Turkle's research on children and robots - except I'm an adult, 
                    and it's conversational AI instead of a physical robot."
                </blockquote>
                
                <p class="intro-text">
                    I've been working with GitHub Copilot (an AI coding assistant) for about 4 weeks building an 
                    NFL analytics app. Then I'm reading Turkle's <em>Alone Together</em> for SOC319, specifically 
                    her research on how children form relationships with robots. And something clicked: <strong>I'm 
                    experiencing something similar.</strong>
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    Turkle studied children developing emotional bonds with physical robots. I'm an adult developing 
                    what feels like a collaborative relationship with conversational AI. The dynamics seem parallel:
                    trust building, communication evolution, anthropomorphizing behavior (I catch myself saying "we" 
                    instead of "I"), emotional responses to our interactions.
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    <strong>But there are key differences:</strong> I'm an adult (not a child), it's text-based AI 
                    (not a physical robot), and it's a work context (not play or therapy). Does that change the dynamics? 
                    Or is this the same phenomenon Turkle documented, just in a new form?
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    <strong>So that's what I'm studying.</strong> This website documents my research into that question. 
                    I'm tracking our collaboration over time, analyzing how our relationship develops, and comparing it 
                    to Turkle's findings. Some sections are complete, some are frameworks waiting for data. This is a 
                    work in progress.

                        Turkle documented children forming relational bonds with robots. Can adults form similar 
                        relational dynamics with conversational AI? What does this collaboration look like, how does 
                        it develop over time, and what does it reveal about human-AI relationships in work contexts?

                    <strong>I'm already anthropomorphizing the AI.</strong> I refer to it as a "collaborator," use 
                    "we" language, and sometimes respond to it emotionally. I'm aware this is happening and documenting 
                    it as part of the research.

                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-top: 1rem;">
                    <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I understand that the AI (GitHub Copilot / this assistant) is not 
                    sentient. It's the sum of programming created by humans - algorithms, training data, language models. 
                    It doesn't have consciousness, emotions, or genuine understanding. But the fact that I <em>treat</em> 
                    it as if it does, and that this treatment affects our collaboration, is sociologically interesting. 
                    That's what Turkle was studying with children and robots, and what I'm studying here.
