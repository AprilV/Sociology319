                    For the past four weeks, I have been working with GitHub Copilot, an AI coding assistant, to build 
                    an NFL analytics application for another course. While reading Turkle's <em>Alone Together</em> 
                    for SOC319, I noticed a disconnect. Turkle describes isolation, emotional dependency, and degraded 
                    human connection through technology. My experience with AI collaboration does not match that pattern. 
                    The relationship functions more like a professional working partnership than the problematic 
                    dynamics Turkle documents.

                <p class="intro-text">
                    This observation led to a second realization. When I discuss AI use with classmates or family, 
                    their responses cluster into three categories: fear (often invoking "Terminator" scenarios), 
                    ethical concern (viewing AI assistance as academic dishonesty), or complete unfamiliarity with 
                    how to use these tools effectively. <strong>This disparity may represent a new form of digital divide.</strong>

                            collaboration patterns, many demonstrate fear-based avoidance, ethical confusion, or

                        I can use it to explain why some people try AI (benefits seem worth it) and why others
