                    So here's what happened: I've been working with GitHub Copilot (an AI coding assistant) for about 
                    4 weeks now to build an NFL analytics app for another class. And while reading Turkle's "Alone Together" 
                    for SOC319, I had this moment where I realized‚ÄîI'm not experiencing isolation or weird attachment 
                    issues like she describes. I'm actually having a pretty normal working relationship, just... with AI.

                <p class="intro-text">
                    Then I started noticing that when I talk to classmates or family about using AI, they're either 
                    scared of it ("Terminator" references, seriously), think it's cheating, or have no idea how to use 
                    it effectively. And that's when it hit me: <strong>this might be a new kind of digital divide.</strong>

                            scared of it or don't know how to use it well. I think this creates a new kind of inequality‚Äî

                            notes on how I learned to work with AI, what worked, what didn't, and how it felt different

                        <h4>Social Exchange Theory</h4>
                        <p><strong>Why:</strong> This is about weighing costs vs. benefits in relationships. 
                        I can use it to explain why some people try AI (benefits seem worth it) and why others 
                        avoid it (costs like fear or time feel too high).</p>

                        <h4>Symbolic Interactionism</h4>
                        <p><strong>Why:</strong> This theory looks at how people communicate and create shared 
                        meanings. Seems relevant because working with AI is all about figuring out how to 
                        communicate effectively.</p>
