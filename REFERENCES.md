## As-If Partnership: Adult-AI Collaboration in the Robotic Moment

---

## Primary Theoretical Framework

**Turkle, Sherry.** (2011). *Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other.* Basic Books.

- **Focus:** Part Two — "Of Robots and Moonlight" (pp. 19-154)
- **Content:** Turkle's ethnographic research on children developing relational bonds with robots (AIBO, Furby, Paro, My Real Baby)
- **Key Concepts:** 
  - "As-if relationships" — humans interacting with AI *as if* it's a genuine partner
  - "Evocative objects/behaviors" — technology that triggers emotional responses
  - "The robotic moment" — cultural shift toward relating to machines as potential partners
  - "Authenticity vs. performance" — can simulated care substitute for genuine care?
- **Relevance:** Primary theoretical framework for understanding my 6+ weeks of human-AI collaboration

- **Key Concepts:**
  - Media equation — humans treat computers like real people
  - CASA (Computers As Social Actors) paradigm
  - Mindless application of social rules to technology
- **Why This Source:** Foundational research demonstrating humans unconsciously apply social norms to computers. Explains why I treat AI with politeness, reciprocity, and partnership framing despite knowing it's algorithmic.

  - Autoethnography as valid qualitative research method
  - Researcher-as-subject approach
  - Reflexivity and positionality
  - Personal narrative as sociological data
- **Why This Source:** Legitimizes autoethnographic methodology — studying one's own experience as valid sociological research. Addresses how researcher subjectivity and self-observation constitute rigorous data collection.

### 3. Anthropomorphism and Trust

**Waytz, Adam, Joy Heafner, and Nicholas Epley.** (2014). "The Mind in the Machine: Anthropomorphism Increases Trust in an Autonomous Vehicle." *Journal of Experimental Social Psychology*, 52, 113-117.

- **Length:** ~5 pages (SHORT — easiest read!)
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Anthropomorphism definition and mechanisms
  - Relationship between mind attribution and trust
  - Human tendency to see agency in non-human entities
- **Key Finding:** Attributing mental states to machines increases user trust, even when users know the machine isn't conscious
- **Why This Source:** Empirical evidence that anthropomorphizing technology increases trust and reliance. Directly supports my observed trust development pattern (Week 1: verify everything → Week 6: implement without checking).
- **Access:** University database (ScienceDirect, PsycINFO)

### 4. Long-Term Human-Computer Relationships

**Bickmore, Timothy W., and Rosalind W. Picard.** (2005). "Establishing and Maintaining Long-Term Human-Computer Relationships." *ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction*, 12(2), 293-327.

- **Length:** ~35 pages total (but focus on relevant sections: Introduction, Related Work, Relationship Maintenance sections = ~10-15 pages)
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Relational agents vs. transactional interfaces
  - Social-emotional communication with computers
  - Relationship maintenance strategies over time
  - Trust development in extended interactions
- **Why This Source:** Research on how humans develop ongoing relationships with AI agents over extended periods. Distinguishes between transactional interactions vs. relational dynamics — matching my communication evolution from "create function X" to "we need to handle standings."
- **Access:** ACM Digital Library (via university access)

### 5. GitHub Copilot Collaboration Study

**Barke, Shraddha, Michael B. James, and Nadia Polikarpova.** (2023). "Grounded Copilot: How Programmers Interact with Code-Generating Models." *Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages*, 7(OOPSLA1), 85-111.

- **Length:** ~27 pages (focus on User Study sections = ~10-15 pages)
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Human-AI pair programming dynamics
  - Trust calibration with code-generating models
  - Verification behaviors and acceptance patterns
  - Programmer workflows with AI assistants
- **Why This Source:** Recent empirical research on **GitHub Copilot specifically** — the exact tool I'm using. Documents how programmers collaborate with AI pair programming assistants, including trust development, communication patterns, and verification strategies.
- **Relevance:** Provides workplace context for adult-AI collaboration, distinguishing it from Turkle's children-robot play scenarios
- **Access:** ACM Digital Library or search "Grounded Copilot OOPSLA 2023" (may have free preprint on authors' websites)

### 5. [ALTERNATIVE] Workplace AI Collaboration (If Copilot study unavailable)

**Jarrahi, Mohammad Hossein, David Askay, Ali Eshraghi, and Preston Smith.** (2019). "Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Work: Human-AI Symbiosis in Organizational Decision Making." *Business Horizons*, 62(4), 577-586.

- **Length:** ~10 pages
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Human-AI symbiosis in professional contexts
  - Complementary strengths of humans and AI
  - Collaboration dynamics vs. replacement concerns
  - Augmentation paradigm
- **Why This Source (backup):** Broader workplace AI collaboration research if the Copilot-specific study is hard to access. Discusses human-AI symbiosis, complementary strengths, and collaboration dynamics in professional contexts.
- **Access:** University database (ScienceDirect, Business Source Complete)

## How These Sources Support My Research

### Theoretical Foundation
**Turkle (2011)** provides the primary framework: as-if relationships, evocative behaviors, the robotic moment, authenticity vs. performance. My research extends her children-robot findings to adult-AI workplace context.

### Psychological Mechanisms
**Nass & Moon (2000)** + **Waytz et al. (2014)** explain *why* I unconsciously treat AI as social partner and why anthropomorphizing increased my trust over 6 weeks. These establish the psychological basis for "as-if relationships."

### Methodological Legitimacy
**Ellis et al. (2011)** validates autoethnography as rigorous qualitative method — my 2,700+ lines of documented self-observation constitutes valid sociological data, not just personal journaling.

### Relational Development
**Bickmore & Picard (2005)** documents how human-computer relationships develop over time, providing framework for my communication evolution from transactional to relational.

### Contextual Application
**Barke et al. (2023)** OR **Jarrahi et al. (2019)** situate my experience within broader human-AI collaboration research, showing relational dynamics emerge specifically in workplace AI tools like GitHub Copilot.

## Reading Priority Order

**If short on time, read in this order:**

1. **Ellis et al. (2011)** — FREE, short (~15 pages), establishes methodology validity
2. **Waytz et al. (2014)** — Shortest (~5 pages), core anthropomorphism concept
3. **Turkle (2011) Part Two** — Primary framework (focus on chapters most relevant to your experience)
4. **Nass & Moon (2000)** — CASA foundation (~15-20 pages)

- (Waytz et al., 2014)

**When quoting Turkle in your website:**
> As Turkle (2011) describes, children developed "as-if relationships" with robots — "they relate to the robot as if it were sentient" despite knowing it's not alive (p. 28).
