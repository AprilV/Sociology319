# PROJECT STATUS - November 4, 2025

## WHAT THIS PROJECT IS ABOUT

**Topic:** Digital Divide - AI Literacy Gap  
**Chosen from professor's list:** "Digital divides (suggest you pick one)"  
**Our specific focus:** Unequal access to AI collaboration skills

## THE PROBLEM (What we're studying)

**Who has AI literacy:**
- April (56, IT background, learned to collaborate with AI effectively)
- Built NFL app in 6 weeks with GitHub Copilot
- Documented in SOCIOLOGY.md (2,700+ lines)

**Who lacks AI literacy:**
- Classmates (fear AI, "Terminator" references, avoid using it)
- Older adults April talks to (confused, intimidated)
- People without technical background

**This gap = Digital Divide in AI access/skills**

## ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS

From professor's instructions:

1. ✅ **Comprehensive discussion of problem** - Define AI literacy divide, provide evidence
2. ❌ **THREE existing strategies** - Real programs/policies/initiatives addressing the gap (NEED TO RESEARCH)
3. ✅ **Your individual role** - April as educator/bridge-builder
4. ✅ **5+ sources (2 peer-reviewed)** - Already identified
5. ✅ **Format: Website** - Already built

## CURRENT WEBSITE STRUCTURE

**Pages:**
- **Home** - Introduction (TOO MUCH CONTENT - needs cleanup)
- **Context** - Problem definition with Turkle framework
- **Our Collaboration** - April's 6-week experience (case study data)
- **Broader Implications** - NEEDS 3 STRATEGIES (currently wrong content)
- **Reflexivity** - April's personal role
- **Methodology** - Autoethnography approach
- **References** - Sources (need APA formatting)

## WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NEXT

### IMMEDIATE (This week):
1. Clean up HOME page - too much text
2. Research 3 REAL strategies addressing AI literacy divide:
   - Example: Google AI training courses
   - Example: EU AI literacy policies
   - Example: Non-profit AI education programs
3. Write these on "Broader Implications" page with EVIDENCE
4. Add APA citations throughout

### Evidence Requirements:
- April's experience = Case study (qualitative data) - VALID
- Classmate reactions = Ethnographic observations - VALID but need specific quotes
- Digital divide stats = Need Pew Research data, academic sources
- 3 Strategies = Need to research real programs with evidence they work (or don't)

## KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER

1. **April's 6-week collaboration IS valid research data** (autoethnography method)
2. **Opinions need support** - Use quotes, stats, academic sources
3. **Website format approved** - Professor said any format except PowerPoint
4. **Topic approved** - Digital divide from professor's list
5. **Main gap:** 3 strategies page not written yet

## STUDENT FRUSTRATIONS (Valid concerns)

- AI keeps forgetting context from earlier conversations
- Instructions given multiple times but not referenced
- Going in circles, backtracking
- Not discussing before making changes
- Slow response times
- Website structure confusing

## NEXT SESSION GOALS

1. Don't question the topic - it's decided (Digital Divide - AI Literacy)
2. Don't redesign structure - just fill in missing content
3. Focus ONLY on: Writing the 3 strategies with evidence
4. Ask questions BEFORE making changes
5. Reference this file at start of session
