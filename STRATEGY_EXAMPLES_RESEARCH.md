- **Research questions:**
  - Does conversational interface reduce fear/intimidation?
  - Do non-technical users adopt conversational AI more than traditional tools?
  - Quality of outputs - do beginners get hallucinations/errors?
  - Digital divide - still requires internet, device, literacy
- **Search terms:** "conversational AI adoption," "ChatGPT accessibility," "natural language AI interfaces"

#### Example 3C: Low-Code/No-Code AI Platforms
- **Example:** Google AutoML, Microsoft Power Platform AI Builder
- **Goal:** Let non-programmers build/use AI without coding
- **How it works:** Drag-and-drop interfaces, pre-built models, templates
- **Research questions:**
  - Who actually uses these - true beginners, or still tech-savvy users?
  - Quality of results - do they work well enough?
  - Cost - many charge enterprise pricing, excluding individuals
  - Do they democratize AI or just shift who the experts are?
- **Search terms:** "no-code AI platforms," "AutoML accessibility," "democratizing AI development"

**PICK ONE. Evaluate:**
- ✅ Does better UX actually solve literacy problem?
- ❌ Who's still excluded (cost, digital access, language)?
- 📊 Evidence of adoption by non-technical users?

## RESEARCH PROCESS

### Step 1: Choose Your 3 Examples
Pick ONE from each category (education, policy, technology)

**Variation requirement:** Don't pick three similar approaches!
- ❌ BAD: Three different AI training courses (too similar)
- ✅ GOOD: Google training + EU AI Act + ChatGPT interface (very different approaches)

### Step 2: Research Each Strategy (1 hour per strategy)

**For each, find answers to:**
1. **What is it?** (Brief description)
2. **Who does it target?** (Intended beneficiaries)
3. **What's the evidence?**
   - Success stories / positive outcomes
   - Limitations / criticisms
   - Who's excluded / not helped by this approach
4. **Does it work?** (Your evaluation based on evidence)

### Step 3: Find Reliable Sources

**Look for:**
- ✅ Academic studies evaluating the program/policy
- ✅ Government reports with data
- ✅ Tech journalism from reputable outlets (Wired, MIT Tech Review, Ars Technica)
- ✅ Organization's own published data (if credible)
- ❌ Avoid: Marketing materials only, opinion pieces without data

**Search databases:**
- Google Scholar (academic studies)
- University library databases
- Tech news archives
- Policy think tanks (Brookings, Pew Research, Data & Society)

### Step 4: Cite Everything

As you research, keep track of:
- Author(s)
- Date published
- Title
- Source/publication
- URL (if online)

You'll need these for APA citations.
