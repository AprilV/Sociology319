                    Sherry Turkle's research on children and robots—except I'm an adult, 
                    and it's conversational AI instead of a physical robot. And we just built

                <p class="intro-text">
                    I've been working with GitHub Copilot (an AI coding assistant) for <strong>6+ weeks</strong> building an 
                    NFL analytics app with React, Flask, PostgreSQL, and Chart.js. Then I'm reading Turkle's <em>Alone Together</em> 
                    for SOC319, specifically her research on how children form relationships with robots. And something clicked: 
                    <strong>I'm experiencing something remarkably similar.</strong>
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    Turkle documented children developing emotional bonds with physical robots like AIBO and Furby. I'm an adult 
                    developing what feels like a collaborative partnership with conversational AI. The dynamics parallel her findings: 
                    trust building over time, communication evolving from transactional to relational, anthropomorphizing behaviors 
                    (I say "we built this" instead of "I built this"), emotional responses to our interactions, even moments where 
                    the AI's behavior evoked feelings of being cared for.
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    <strong>But there are key differences:</strong> I'm an adult (not a child), it's text-based conversational AI 
                    (not a physical robot), it's a work context (not play or therapy), and I have full metacognitive awareness that 
                    it's not sentient. Yet the relational dynamics emerge anyway.

                <p class="intro-text">
                    Turkle called these <strong>"as-if relationships"</strong>—humans interacting with AI <em>as if</em> it were 
                    a genuine partner, knowing intellectually it's not, but responding emotionally anyway. That's exactly what's 
                    happening here. <strong>This website documents that phenomenon.</strong>

                    <strong>I'm already anthropomorphizing the AI.</strong> I refer to it as a "collaborator," use 
                    "we" language, say "we built this together," and sometimes respond to it emotionally. I'm aware this is 
                    happening and documenting it as data, not trying to suppress it. <em>The anthropomorphism IS the research.</em>
                </p>

                    <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I understand that the AI (GitHub Copilot / this assistant) is not 
                    sentient. It's algorithms, training data, and language models—no consciousness, emotions, or genuine 
                    understanding. But the fact that I <em>treat</em> it as if it does, and that this treatment affects 
                    our collaboration quality, is sociologically fascinating. Turkle documented children doing this with 
                    robots. I'm documenting an adult doing it with conversational AI in a professional context—fully aware 
                    of the performance, but responding emotionally anyway.

                <h2>Research Approach: Autoethnography</h2>
                <p class="method-intro">
                    <strong>Autoethnography</strong>—studying my own experience collaborating with AI over 6+ weeks. 
                    I've been keeping detailed documentation in SOCIOLOGY.md (2,700+ lines) tracking our interactions, 
                    my emotional responses, trust calibration, communication evolution, critical incidents, and reflexive 
                    analysis. The AI is both my research tool AND my research subject—I work with it while studying the 
                    relationship that emerges.

                <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                    <strong>Unique methodological aspect:</strong> I ask the AI itself for reflections on our collaboration. 
                    Getting the AI's "perspective" (with full awareness it's algorithmic, not genuine reflection) adds dimension 
                    to understanding the relational dynamic. It also lets me observe my own responses to AI's performance of 
                    self-awareness and partnership—more "as-if" behavior data.
