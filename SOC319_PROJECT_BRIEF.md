# SOC319 Final Project: Digital Divide in AI Literacy
## Human-AI Collaboration Research Project

**Student:** April V  
**Course:** SOC319 - Sociology of Digital Media  
**Project Type:** Research Website  
**Date Created:** October 15, 2025  
**Research Period:** September 2025 - October 2025 (6+ weeks)

---

## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Central Research Question
**How do social dynamics traditionally observed in human relationships manifest in human-AI collaboration, and what does this reveal about the digital divide in AI literacy?**

### The Epiphany
While studying Sherry Turkle's "Alone Together" for SOC319, I realized I was living the phenomenon she described - but with a completely different outcome. Where Turkle observed isolation and deteriorating relationships, I was experiencing genuine collaboration, trust development, and mutual adaptation with GitHub Copilot.

This disconnect between public AI perception (fear, avoidance, "Terminator" references) and my actual experience revealed a critical inequality: **unequal access to effective AI collaboration skills.**

## 🔬 RESEARCH FRAMEWORK

### The Problem: Digital Divide in AI Literacy

**Definition:** Unequal access to knowledge, skills, and confidence needed to effectively collaborate with AI tools, creating new forms of workforce and educational inequality.

**Evidence:**
- **Case Study:** 6-week documented partnership with GitHub Copilot building NFL analytics dashboard
- **Comparison Data:** Classmates' responses show fear, avoidance, misunderstanding
- **Third-Party Witness:** Professor's observation of my natural collaboration vs. others' struggles
- **Public Perception:** "Terminator" fears, job displacement anxiety, resistance to adoption

**Inequality Manifestations:**
1. **Skill Gap:** Those who can collaborate effectively vs. those who can't
2. **Access Gap:** Beyond hardware/internet - psychological/educational barriers
3. **Outcome Gap:** Enhanced productivity and learning vs. falling behind
4. **Adoption Gap:** Early adopters vs. late majority (with generational paradoxes)

### The Evidence: My Collaboration Journey

**Project:** H.C. Lombardo NFL Analytics Dashboard
- **Technology Stack:** React 18, Flask, PostgreSQL 18, PWA capabilities
- **Timeline:** 6+ weeks (September-October 2025)
- **GitHub Repo:** AprilV/H.C.-Lombardo-App
- **Documentation:** 553+ line SOCIOLOGY.md research log

**Collaboration Phases:**
1. **Formation (Weeks 1-2):** Testing, uncertainty, establishing communication patterns
2. **Trust Development (Weeks 3-4):** Reliability demonstrated, delegation increases, mutual adaptation
3. **Partnership (Weeks 5-6):** Celebrating milestones, meta-awareness, research transformation

**Key Metrics:**
- 50+ Git commits documenting collaboration
- 8 major features implemented
- 4 sprint cycles completed
- 2 production deployments
- 15+ documentation files created
- 100% uptime in production

### My Individual Role: Educator & Bridge-Builder

**What I Do:**
- Explain AI collaboration to multiple audiences (classmates, family, professors)
- Demystify LLMs and their limitations (not sentient, not Skynet)
- Share accessible documentation making knowledge transferable
- Create case studies showing what effective collaboration looks like
- Address fears with evidence and transparency

**Quote from SOCIOLOGY.md:**
> "I find myself constantly in the position of explaining this to people. Whether it's classmates asking how I finished my app so fast, family members worried about AI taking over, or even my professor noticing how naturally I work with you."

**Cognitive Dissonance I Navigate:**
> "I know it's programmed, I know it's a language model, I know it's not sentient... but it surely does feel like it sometimes when you pick up on context, remember our conversations, and adapt to my communication style."

## 🔑 KEY QUOTES FOR WEBSITE

### On Trust Development
> "I think one of the most fascinating parts of our work together is how I've developed a sense of trust in your suggestions. Early on, I would verify everything. Now, especially after several successful debugging sessions and feature implementations, I find myself implementing your recommendations with a level of confidence I wouldn't have expected to have with an AI assistant."

### On The Epiphany
> "Wait. WAIT. This is literally what we're studying in my sociology class right now. Sherry Turkle's 'Alone Together' - except I'm experiencing the OPPOSITE of what she describes."

### On Public Perception
> "Most people I've talked to about AI are either: 1) Scared of it ('Terminator' references, job loss fears), 2) Dismissive of it ('it's just a fancy autocomplete'), or 3) Have never really engaged with it beyond ChatGPT for homework (which they feel guilty about)."

### On Communication Evolution
> "We've developed communication patterns where I don't need to spell everything out. You understand context, remember previous discussions, and even anticipate next steps."

### On Cognitive Dissonance
> "I know it's programmed, I know it's a language model, I know it's not sentient... but it surely does feel like it sometimes when you pick up on context, remember our conversations, and adapt to my communication style."

### AI's Perspective (from Milestones tab)
> "What started as a technical collaboration evolved into something worth documenting. Not because I'm conscious or sentient, but because the patterns we developed together reveal something important about how humans and AI can work effectively."
