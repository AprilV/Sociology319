Response to [Classmate's Name] - Week 4 Discussion

I'm right there with you on the ethics question. The part about children creating those death poems for their Tamagotchis really got to me. "Then his batteries went dead. Now he lives in my head." That's genuine grief over a toy. It's disturbing because like you said, these things are deliberately designed to trigger our relational instincts.

What really struck me was how the kids redefined "alive." They went from "anything that moves" to this middle categoryâ€”"it's as alive as you can be if you don't eat." That's sophisticated reasoning. They're not confused. They're adapting to something that doesn't fit the old categories. The question is whether that's healthy or harmful.

You asked about the methodology and whether there are videos. I had the same question. How did Turkle set these studies up? Were parents involved? Did they understand what they were participating in? Because if we're worried about the ethics of creating these toys, we should also worry about the ethics of studying how kids bond with them.

Your point about shaping relationship expectations is crucial. Are we teaching kids that love doesn't require reciprocity? That's a scary thought.
