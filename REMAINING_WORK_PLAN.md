# SOC319 Final Project - Remaining Work Plan
**Timeline: 3 Weeks Remaining (Nov 4 - Nov 25, 2025)**

## ACTUAL ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS

## Week 2 (Nov 11-17): Research & Evaluate 3 Existing Strategies

### CRITICAL: Find 3 REAL strategies addressing AI literacy divide

**Strategy Selection Criteria:**
- Must be CURRENTLY implemented or piloted (not theoretical)
- Must have VARIATION (not 3 similar programs)
- Must have evidence of effectiveness (or lack thereof)

### Research Strategy 1 - EDUCATION
**Options to investigate:**
- Google AI Essentials (free course launched 2024)
- Microsoft AI Skills Initiative
- K-12 AI literacy curriculum pilots (find specific district/state)
- University AI ethics courses

**For selected strategy, document:**
- [ ] What exactly does it do?
- [ ] Who developed/funds it?
- [ ] Who has access to it? (identifies inequality)
- [ ] Evidence it works (studies, completion rates, outcomes)
- [ ] Who is still excluded? (critical analysis)

### Research Strategy 2 - POLICY
**Options to investigate:**
- EU AI Act (passed 2024)
- US Executive Order on AI (Biden Oct 2023)
- State-level AI regulation (California, NY, Colorado)
- GDPR Right to Explanation provisions

**For selected strategy, document:**
- [ ] What does the policy require?
- [ ] Who does it protect/benefit?
- [ ] Evidence of effectiveness or compliance
- [ ] Limitations and who it doesn't reach
- [ ] How it addresses literacy/access gaps

### Research Strategy 3 - TECHNOLOGY/ACCESS
**Options to investigate:**
- Public library AI access programs
- Community college AI training initiatives
- Non-profit AI literacy organizations (AI4ALL, etc.)
- Low-cost AI tools for underserved communities

**For selected strategy, document:**
- [ ] What service/tool is provided?
- [ ] Who can access it?
- [ ] Evidence of uptake/impact
- [ ] Funding and sustainability
- [ ] Gaps in coverage

### Priority 2: Analyze Your Collaboration Data
- [ ] Code SOCIOLOGY.md for themes related to literacy/learning
- [ ] Document what helped YOU learn to work with AI
- [ ] Identify barriers someone without your background would face
- [ ] This becomes evidence for why literacy matters

### Priority 3: Write `strategies.html` (Discussion page)
- [ ] Write formal evaluation of each strategy
- [ ] Include evidence of effectiveness
- [ ] Critical analysis: who benefits, who's excluded
- [ ] Compare strategies (variation in approach)
- [ ] Add APA citations for all claims

- [ ] How you can address the problem:
  - Share knowledge with peers/colleagues
  - Advocate for AI training in workplaces
  - Mentor others navigating AI tools

## Key Reminders

1. **Problem must be sociological**: Who is disadvantaged? What inequality does it perpetuate?
2. **Strategies must be REAL**: Not hypothetical, currently implemented somewhere
3. **Need VARIATION**: Don't pick 3 training programs - pick education, policy, technology
4. **Evidence required**: Studies, data, reports showing if strategies work
5. **Your role is important**: Use your experience, don't dismiss it
6. **Academic tone**: Formal, third-person when possible, cited evidence
7. **Website IS acceptable format**: Professor said "make a website" is fine
