## 📖 Project Overview

This website examines the **digital divide in AI literacy** - the unequal access to knowledge, skills, and confidence needed to effectively use AI tools. The project explores how this new form of inequality affects workforce opportunities and educational outcomes.

**Central Argument:**  
While 66% of Americans have never used ChatGPT and many fear or avoid AI, those who can collaborate with AI gain significant advantages. This creates a NEW digital divide that goes beyond internet access.

## 🎨 Three Strategies Evaluated

1. **Education & Training Programs** - Teaching AI literacy through courses/workshops
2. **Policy & Regulation** - Government mandates for transparency and accountability
3. **Technology Solutions** - Making AI more accessible through better design

**Analysis:** Each strategy has strengths and limitations. None alone solves the divide. The missing piece is **human intermediaries** (educators, mentors, trusted guides) to address fear and build confidence.

## 👤 My Individual Role

**Educator & Bridge-Builder**

I naturally explain AI to skeptical audiences:
- Classmates who fear AI
- Family members worried about "Terminator" scenarios
- Older adults perplexed by AI tools
- Students avoiding AI due to concerns

My role: Demystify AI, address fears with evidence, make knowledge transferable through documentation and real-world examples.

## � Evidence: Case Study

My 6-week collaboration with GitHub Copilot building the H.C. Lombardo NFL Dashboard demonstrates:
- AI literacy CAN be learned (I had IT background but no AI experience)
- Effective collaboration requires trust development
- Those with AI skills gain productivity advantages
- The divide is real: I succeeded while classmates avoided AI entirely

**Documentation:** 553+ lines of observations archived in old project folder (available for reference)

## 📦 Archive Note

**Old project files moved to:** `_ARCHIVE_OLD_AI_HUMAN_INTERACTION_PROJECT/`

The original project topic was "Human-AI Collaboration: As-If Partnership" which focused on relationship psychology. That was changed to **Digital Divide in AI Literacy** which focuses on inequality.

The old files were creating confusion by mixing different theoretical frameworks and sources. They're preserved for reference but NOT used in the current project.
