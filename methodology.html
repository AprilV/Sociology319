                <p class="intro-text">
                    Basically: I'm studying my own experience working with AI and trying to find patterns that might 
                    apply to other people too.

                <p style="padding: 1rem; background-color: #e8f4f8; border-left: 4px solid #0066cc; border-radius: 4px;">
                    <strong>What autoethnography means:</strong> You analyze your own experience to understand bigger 
                    social/cultural stuff. Instead of pretending to be objective, you acknowledge that YOUR perspective 
                    gives you insight—especially when studying something new that not many people have experienced yet.

                        <p>Human-AI collaboration is happening RIGHT NOW. Traditional research takes years. By 
                        studying my own experience in real-time, I can document patterns as they emerge.</p>

                        You can't really observe that from outside. Studying my own thoughts gives access to that.</p>

                        conversation transcripts). That's way more detail than I'd get from interviewing someone else.</p>

                                Third-party reactions (classmates, family) are reported without identifying 
                                information. Quotes are paraphrased to protect privacy while preserving meaning. Public 
                                GitHub repositories contain only technical content, not personal information.

                                Autoethnography risks privileging researcher's perspective. This study acknowledges that 
                                my experience represents one position (early adopter, technically skilled, educationally 
                                privileged) and does not claim to represent all AI users or non-users.

                                Discussion of "collaboration" and "partnership" with AI requires ethical care. This 
                                research uses these terms descriptively (patterns resemble human collaboration) without 
                                claiming AI possesses consciousness, agency, or rights. Maintaining this distinction 
                                prevents both over-attribution and dismissal of significant sociotechnical dynamics.

                                Researching my own successful collaboration while others struggle raises ethical 
                                questions about privilege and responsibility. This research responds by making knowledge 
                                openly accessible, advocating for systemic change, and explicitly analyzing structural 
                                inequalities rather than attributing outcomes to individual merit.

                <h2>What This Research Contributes (I Hope)</h2>
                
                <p>If I do this right, this project should:</p>

                <ul style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.9; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <li>Show what AI collaboration actually FEELS like from inside (psychological stuff usually invisible)</li>
                    <li>Document trust development patterns (maybe useful for other people learning AI?)</li>
                    <li>Connect my personal experience to bigger inequality issues (structural not individual)</li>
                    <li>Demonstrate that autoethnography works for studying new tech phenomena</li>
                    <li>Create accessible documentation that's useful beyond just academics</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="margin-top: 2rem; padding: 1rem; background-color: #e8f4f8; border-left: 4px solid #0066cc; border-radius: 4px;">
                    <strong>My hope:</strong> By making visible what's usually invisible (social dynamics of human-AI 
                    collaboration), this helps public understanding, academic research, AND gives people practical ideas 
                    for addressing the AI literacy divide.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; color: #7f8c8d;">
                    <em>→ Is that ambitious enough for a final project? Or too ambitious?</em>
                </p>

                    <strong>Next Steps:</strong> Need to find those 3+ additional sources, finish literature review, 
                    and write formal analysis connecting theory to observations. This methodology page explains the 
                    plan—actual research execution continues as I work through the project.
