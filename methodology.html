                <p class="intro-text">
                    This research employs <strong>autoethnography</strong>—a qualitative research method that uses 
                    systematic analysis of personal experience to understand broader cultural, social, and political 
                    phenomena. Rather than claiming objective distance, autoethnography acknowledges the researcher's 
                    subjectivity as a source of insight, particularly when studying emerging phenomena where lived 
                    experience provides unique access.

                                Human-AI collaboration represents a rapidly evolving social phenomenon. Traditional 
                                research methods lag behind technological change. Autoethnography allows real-time 
                                documentation as collaboration patterns emerge, capturing dynamics that retrospective 
                                surveys or interviews might miss.

                            <p>
                                Effective AI collaboration requires navigating cognitive dissonance, developing trust, 
                                and managing emotions—internal experiences difficult to observe externally. 
                                Autoethnography provides access to these psychological dimensions through systematic 
                                self-observation and reflection.

                                Over six weeks, I generated detailed documentation (conversation transcripts, commit 
                                messages, technical documentation, reflective observations) totaling 553+ lines. This 
                                longitudinal data provides context and depth unavailable through cross-sectional 
                                methods.

                                (code quality, implementation strategies, debugging approaches) alongside social

                                Autoethnography integrates these typically separate domains.

                                <strong>Limitation:</strong> Single-subject research limits generalization to broader 
                                populations. My experience may not represent typical human-AI collaboration.

                                <strong>Mitigation:</strong> Autoethnography aims for analytical generalization 
                                (identifying transferable patterns) rather than statistical generalization. Comparison 
                                with third-party responses and existing literature provides validation.

                                Technical artifacts (commits, transcripts) provide objective verification. Reflexive 
                                awareness of bias makes subjective positioning visible rather than hidden.

                                <strong>Mitigation:</strong> Longitudinal observation continues beyond formal research 
                                period. Findings represent early-stage collaboration, explicitly acknowledging temporal 
                                limitations.

                <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                    These limitations don't invalidate findings—they contextualize them. Autoethnography provides 
                    depth and access to psychological dimensions that complement broader survey or experimental 
                    research. Methodological triangulation (combining approaches) strengthens overall understanding.

                    This research integrates personal observation with established academic literature on technology, 
                    inequality, and human-computer interaction. All sources follow APA citation format as required.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Relevance:</strong> Turkle's research on technology-mediated relationships forms the 
                        theoretical foundation this study responds to. Where Turkle observes isolation and deteriorating 
                        human connection, this research documents collaboration and relationship development—suggesting 
                        AI interaction may differ from social media and robots she studied.

                                Autoethnography risks privileging researcher's perspective. This study acknowledges that 
                                my experience represents one position (early adopter, technically skilled, educationally 
                                privileged) and does not claim to represent all AI users or non-users.

                                Discussion of "collaboration" and "partnership" with AI requires ethical care. This 
                                research uses these terms descriptively (patterns resemble human collaboration) without 
                                claiming AI possesses consciousness, agency, or rights. Maintaining this distinction 
                                prevents both over-attribution and dismissal of significant sociotechnical dynamics.

                                inequalities rather than attributing outcomes to individual merit.
