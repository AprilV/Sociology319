                <p class="intro-text">
                    <strong>The digital divide in AI literacy</strong> represents unequal access to the knowledge, 
                    skills, and psychological readiness required to effectively collaborate with artificial intelligence 
                    tools. Unlike traditional digital divides focused on hardware and internet access, this divide 
                    centers on cognitive, educational, and emotional barriers that prevent individuals from harnessing 
                    AI's potential.
                </p>

                <blockquote class="feature-quote">
                    "Most people I've talked to about AI are either: 1) Scared of it ('Terminator' references, 
                    job loss fears), 2) Dismissive of it ('it's just a fancy autocomplete'), or 3) Have never 
                    really engaged with it beyond ChatGPT for homework (which they feel guilty about)."
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    This inequality matters because AI collaboration skills are rapidly becoming essential for 
                    educational success and economic opportunity. Those who can effectively partner with AI gain 
                    significant advantages in productivity, learning speed, and problem-solving capability‚Äîadvantages 
                    that compound over time, widening the gap between early adopters and those left behind.

                                <strong>Definition:</strong> Differential ability to communicate effectively with AI, 
                                iterate on outputs, and leverage AI as a collaborative partner rather than just a tool.

                                context-sharing and strategic planning with AI, classmates struggle with basic prompting 
                                and view AI outputs as final products rather than starting points for collaboration.

                                <strong>Definition:</strong> Fear, mistrust, and anxiety about AI that prevent engagement 
                                regardless of technical access or capability.

                                displacement anxiety, concerns about AI "taking over," and moral guilt about using AI 
                                assistance. Even my professor noted that younger students often show more fear than 
                                older professionals.

                                <strong>Definition:</strong> Lack of systematic instruction in AI collaboration, leaving

                                experimentation, documentation, and reflection‚Äîresources not available to everyone. 
                                Most educational institutions ban or restrict AI use rather than teaching effective

                <p>
                    Traditional digital divide research focuses on <strong>access</strong>‚Äîwho has computers, internet 
                    connectivity, and technological infrastructure. The AI literacy divide extends beyond access to

                        <p>Understanding AI capabilities and limitations requires navigating cognitive dissonance: 
                        simultaneously knowing AI isn't sentient while responding to its apparent understanding.</p>

                <h2>The Paradox: Access Without Ability</h2>

                <p>
                    Perhaps the most striking aspect of the AI literacy divide is that it exists <strong>despite 
                    widespread access</strong> to AI tools. GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and similar technologies are 
                    readily available, often free or low-cost. Yet utilization rates and effectiveness vary dramatically.

                    "I find myself constantly in the position of explaining this to people. Whether it's classmates 
                    asking how I finished my app so fast, family members worried about AI taking over, or even my 
                    professor noticing how naturally I work with you."
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    This paradox reveals that the barrier isn't technological‚Äîit's educational, psychological, and 
                    social. Simply providing access to AI tools doesn't ensure effective use, just as providing access 
                    to libraries doesn't guarantee literacy. The intervention strategies must address these deeper 
                    barriers, not just technical access.
