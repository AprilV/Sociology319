                <p class="intro-text">
                    Everyone I know has access to AI tools. ChatGPT is free. GitHub Copilot is free for students. 
                    There are dozens of AI tools available to anyone with an internet connection. But when I talk 
                    to people about using AI‚Äîclassmates, family, random people I meet‚Äîthey respond in really 
                    different ways. Most people are either scared, confused about whether it's "cheating," or have 
                    tried it once and given up because they didn't know what to do with it.
                </p>

                <blockquote class="feature-quote">
                    "Most people I've talked to about AI are either: 1) Scared of it ('Terminator' references, 
                    job loss fears), 2) Dismissive of it ('it's just a fancy autocomplete'), or 3) Have never 
                    really engaged with it beyond ChatGPT for homework (which they feel guilty about)."
                    <br><em>‚Äî From my notes, Week 3</em>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    So the problem isn't about access to technology‚Äîit's about <strong>knowing how to use it 
                    effectively</strong> and <strong>being psychologically ready to try</strong>. This looks like 
                    a new kind of inequality. Not the traditional "digital divide" we learned about (some people 
                    have internet, some don't), but something different‚Äîa skills and mindset gap.
                </p>

                    <em><strong>TO DO:</strong> Find sources about "second-level digital divide" (skills beyond 
                    just access). Look for research on AI literacy, technology adoption barriers, psychological 
                    resistance to new technology.</em>

                            <p>Some people know how to "talk" to AI, some don't. When I first started, I'd write 
                            these super detailed prompts. Now I can be casual and conversational. But people who 
                            try AI once? They're either way too vague or way too specific, then get frustrated 
                            when it doesn't work right.</p>

                            <p>People are genuinely afraid. Terminator jokes aren't really jokes‚Äîthey're actually 
                            worried about AI. Some think using it is cheating even when it's allowed. That fear 
                            stops them from even trying.</p>

                    <li><strong>Everyone has access.</strong> AI tools are free or cheap. You don't need expensive 
                    equipment. So it's not about money or having technology.</li>
                    <li><strong>It's about skills and mindset.</strong> The barrier is knowing what to do and not 
                    being afraid to try. Like owning a guitar versus knowing how to play it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Psychological factors matter.</strong> Fear, ethical concerns, not understanding 
                    what AI even is‚Äîthese stop people more than lack of access.</li>
