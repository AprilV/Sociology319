                    Okay so here's what I've noticed: I can work with AI pretty effectively. But when I talk to other 
                    people‚Äîclassmates, family, even people in my classes‚Äîthey either have no idea how to use AI, are 
                    scared of it, or think it's going to "take over the world." Everyone has the same access to these 
                    tools (ChatGPT is free, GitHub Copilot is available), but there's this huge gap in who actually 
                    uses them well.

                <blockquote class="feature-quote">
                    "Most people I've talked to about AI are either: 1) Scared of it ('Terminator' references, 
                    job loss fears), 2) Dismissive of it ('it's just a fancy autocomplete'), or 3) Have never 
                    really engaged with it beyond ChatGPT for homework (which they feel guilty about)."

                    So I'm calling this the <strong>"AI Literacy Divide"</strong>‚Äîit's not about having computers or 
                    internet (traditional digital divide), it's about knowing HOW to work with AI and not being too 
                    scared to try.

                <h2>Why This is Different from Regular "Digital Divide"</h2>

                <p>
                    In class we learned about digital divide as who has computers/internet vs. who doesn't. But this 
                    AI thing is different:
                </p>

                <ul style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.9; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <li><strong>Everyone I know has access to AI tools.</strong> ChatGPT is free. GitHub Copilot is 
                    available. It's not an access problem.</li>
                    <li><strong>The barrier is psychological and educational.</strong> People don't know HOW to use it, 
                    or they're too scared to try.</li>
                    <li><strong>It's about skills, not equipment.</strong> Like, you can have a piano but that doesn't 
                    mean you can play it.</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="color: #7f8c8d; margin-top: 2rem;">
                    <em><strong>To research:</strong> Find academic articles about "second-level digital divide" or 
                    "skills gap" - I think that's what this is called?</em>

                <h2>Why This Matters (The "So What?")</h2>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    If some people can work effectively with AI and others can't, that creates real inequality:

                                Jobs that require working with AI will probably pay better. If you can't learn these 
                                skills, you're stuck with worse opportunities.

                                Students who can use AI effectively (without just copy-pasting) will do better. That
